        <p className="mb-4 text-md text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
          mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
          website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
          efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-md text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, McRay Tech Services
          Ltd) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other
          than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party
          cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on
          or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and
          analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can
          recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question
          and also when it visits certain other websites.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mb-4 text-xl font-semibold">Why do we use cookies?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-md text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
          cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to
          operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary"
          cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the
          interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online
          Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for
          advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more
          detail below.

          How can I control cookies?
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-md text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
          can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
          Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to
          select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential
          cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide
          you with services.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-md text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and
          on our Website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
          Website though your access to some functionality and areas of our
          Website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser
          controls to accept or refuse cookies.

          What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-md text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a

          like web beacons (sometimes called{" "}
          <b>"tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"</b>). These are tiny graphics
          files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize
          when someone has visited our Website or opened an email including
          them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of
          users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or
          communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the
          website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party
          website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of
          email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are
          reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will
          impair their functioning.
